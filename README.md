MECCA Music Platform - by BobbiCodes
The Music Education, Composition, Creation Application

A library for exploding audio files into banks of samples transposed according to the equal tempered chromatic scale. Shifts the sample pitches without affecting the duration (tempo) using the WSOLA algorithm. 

## Usage

Includes 3 octaves of the classic Mario Paint samples.

TODO: Allow users to upload their own `wav` files. As long as they are limited to a certain size, I can likely host a large number of community samples.
